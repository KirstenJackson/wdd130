    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This website exists to bring more customers to the Rapids company. Currently awareness is only
        spread through word of mouth, and appointments have to be booked over the phone. Having a website will
        allow customers to learn, explore, and make reservations with ease. The decrease of resistance will 
        increase the number of people that come and enjoy the experience that Rapids has to offer.
        The increase in customers will naturally increase our revenue.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Most current customers are avid white water rafters. Their enthusiasm is definitely appreciated, 
        but we would like to increase our audience. Given the location of Rapids is relatively close to 
        a college campus and a residential area, our focus will be on college students and young families. 
        None of these groups are particularly wealthy, and are usually busy during the week. The financial 
        situations of the memebers of these groups have a great range. However, all need fun and accessible
        things to do. They currently don't see white water rafting as an accesible activity. They need a place
        to get away and enjoy life before getting back to their weekly routines. Devices used to access the 
        site will usually be a mobile device, as most college students and parents are very busy.

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
