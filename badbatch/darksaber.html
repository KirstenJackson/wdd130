            <h1>Everything you need (and don't need) to know about The Darksaber</h1>
            <p>The darksaber is cool. It's one of a kind. It's the only known lightsaber that is black and flat instead of cylindrical. The 
                darksaber was originally created by a the first Mandalorian Jedi Tarre Vizsla. 
                It was passed down all the way down to Pre Vizsla, leader of House Vizsla during the Clone Wars.
            </p>
            <p>Another unique aspect of the darksaber is the rules of inheritance. In order to rightfully wield the darksaber,
                 it must be won in combat. The known order of possession is as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tarre Vizsla</li>
                <li>Pre Vizsla</li>
                <li>Darth Maul</li>
                <li>Sabine Wren</li>
                <li>Bo-Katan Kryze</li>
                <li>Moff Gideon</li>
                <li>Din Djarin</li>
            </ol>

            <p>There was a time after Tarre Vizsla died that the darksaber was kept in the Jedi Temple, but it was stolen by 
                House Vizsla during the fall of the Old Republic. 
            </p>
