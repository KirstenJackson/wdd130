      <h3>Who is Bad Batch?</h3>
      <p>
        
        Bad Batch, or Clone Force 99 originally consisted of four genetically enhanced clones. These clones were engineered to have mutations that made them excel as soldiers. Strength, brains, enhanced senses, and sharp shooting. Two additional clones were introduced into the group, Echo and Omega. Echo is a “reg” or a regular clone. The ARC Trooper was originally believed dead at the Battle of the Citadel, but was rescued from Skako Minor. At the time he was rescued, Echo showed little resemblance to his former self. Much of his body had been replaced with machinery, including a scomp link arm. As a result of the trauma and the changes to his body, Echo was no longer like other regular clones, and as such was offered a spot in Clone Force 99. He accepted the invitation and has been a valuable member ever since. Omega joined the team later, after Order 66 and the establishment of the Galactic Empire. She is the only known female clone and one of two known who is a pure genetic replication of Jango Fett (the other being Boba Fett). Omega’s initial desire to join the squad was rejected.

      <h3>Members</h3>
      <p>
        Hunter
        Leader of Clone Force 99. 
        Skills: enhanced senses, including hearing, something about radiology idk, smell, maybe sight.
        First appearance: Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 7 Episode 1
        Summary: As the leader of the group, Hunter has to think and act in the best interest of everyone collectively. This makes him introspective and decisive. He speaks once he has made up his mind and his word is command. Basically, do what he says. 

        Tech
        Specialty: Brains. Tech was engineered to have greater capacities for retaining information, programming, strategy, analysis, etc. He has the mind of a computer, full of facts and ones and zeroes. His expansive knowledge allows him to understand others more objectively and less empathetically. He does not act out of emotion but out of logical thinking and decisions. 

        Wrecker
        A lot of bark and even more bite. Wrecker’s specialty is…wrecking. His strength is unmatched and he doesn’t mind letting everyone know. 

        Crosshair
        The expert marksman or sniper. He is a man of few words and zero misses. He left the group because it was getting too crowded on the ship. Also, he disagreed with the direction the team was going. Not sure which one was a greater motivation. 

        Echo
        The abnormal “reg”. He’s more machine than man, at least percentage wise (Tech’s words, not mine). Formerly an ARC Trooper in the 501st, he was lost in the Battle of the Citadel and recovered in a rescue mission on Skako Minor. 

        Omega
        Every clone’s favorite sister-and only sister. A (nearly) pure genetic replica of Jango Fett (one obvious difference). She is the latest member of the group and specializes in being adorable. She’s pretty helpless in the beginning, but with the guidance of the best space dads in the galaxy
